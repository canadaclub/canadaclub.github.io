# About us

We are a group of Canadians, Canadian-Swiss and Swiss-Canadians who are organized as Canada Club Berne, which was founded in 1981 and has been going ever since.
We promote relaxed social contacts, Canadian style, among our members. Activities that might be organized by Club members during the year include a Canada Day picnic, Ascension Day biking or hiking, Christmas dinner, snowshoeing,  hiking, etc. Our events usually take place in the greater Bern region, though winter sports usually happen in higher, more snow-endowed areas.

New members — temporary or long-term — are very welcome, so feel free to contact us at {{ site.mailto }} or join us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/canadaclubberne/).

# New to Bern?

Here's an interesting guide to Bern, created by students at the University of Bern. It can be useful for newcomers to the region as well as anyone looking to live more sustainably in and around Bern.
